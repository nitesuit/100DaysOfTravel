They grow bananas, avocados, maracuyas, and other exotic fruits just so the birds and squirrels would eat something else instead of cacao 🐿.\n\nIn the afternoon we had 2 hot bus rides to reach a coastal Palomino town where we plan to enjoy the sea and the sun ☀️.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/e8ff569d36.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2022/2872271656.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2022/7ec9492811.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2022/7bce11b928.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2022/1d00e6a966.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /> <img src=\"uploads/2022/505694f837.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"uploads/2022/e19140e179.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2022/e0af9a3ef8.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" />\n",

To go there you need to take one of the colorful jeeps that are going back and forth from the central square. The valley itself was breathtaking with the views we never witnessed before. Green jungle-like hills were surrounded by extremely tall and lean palm trees in the valley. We enjoyed a 2-hour hike before coming back to the jeeps. The journey back was adventurous. When someone doesn’t fit to sit in the jeep it’s not a problem - locals simply offer you to stand at the back of the car. In our case it was 4 of us made to stand and we barely fit. The car was going fast through the hills and it was our job to hold tight and constantly dodge tree branches along the way 😅.</p>\n\n<p>After lunch, we went to <em>Finca El Ocaso</em> for a coffee tour. Since this is a coffee region there are many local farms called <em>fincas</em> that produce and sell coffee. We went through the whole process ourselves from growing to roasting during the tour.

That still wasn’t enough of an explanation of why would you come to an apartment in the middle of the night?! We contacted the Airbnb host. At first, the housekeeper explained to him that she was told that <em>there is an emergency</em> which also didn’t make sense because how do you know about the emergency in the room that according to you supposed to be empty.

The entry to Colombia was almost as easy as to any European country although we encountered one of the stricter airlines who had to make sure every single dimension and weight of our backpacks did not violate their policies. \n\nIt was well after midnight when we took Uber and went to have our first night's sleep in Bogota.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/b493689227.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2022/66669747cc.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" />\n",

The first hour is for chatting and getting in the mood. Some locals immediately come in the pajamas so you can get a feeling of a family sleepover party. They smoke their home-grown tobacco which they consider sacred. Then the shaman takes a small glass, pours <em>ayahuasca</em>, and invites people one by one. The amount depends on each person. During the first ceremonies, you get very little just to see if there are no unexpected reactions to the body and understand the effects. After drinking <em>ayahuasca</em> the candles are blown and it gets completely dark. Your job as a participant is to set the intention in your mind and just to be calm. Then the shaman begins singing with others occasionally joining in. The singing took on average 4 hours but it can vary from ceremony to ceremony depending on the overall mood. The shaman constantly sits next to participants, sings, asks how they are doing, if needed gives a massage to relax a body or gives advice. During the ceremony, there always comes a point when the family jokes around and laughs a bit just to create a more relaxing and casual feeling. An hour or two after midnight some people leave for their homes while the other part stays in the temple and eventually falls asleep. Throughout the day you meet different family members who are interested in your experience and give guidance for the next ceremony.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2022/7708afc9c6.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2022/90355eadff.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2022/a246cc5678.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n",

We took a tuk-tuk to a river port and jumped in the boat. This was a boat that connects <em>Pucallpa</em> with the communities in the jungle. After a hot 2-hour boat ride which featured a blasting 2010s pop music playlist, we walked through a muddy road to take another tuk-tuk and after half an hour we reached our final destination, a village of <em>Ceilan</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Our tuk-tuk stopped next to uncle Alberto’s house and we immediately met a big part of their family: wife, kids, and grandmothers. A 2-minute walk from the house there was a huge area designed for accomodating guests and organizing ceremonies: barracks for sleeping, a kitchen/dining building, a shower, and 2 wooden temples. We met another friend from Machu Picchu Bogdan who was the only other guest/foreigner there at the moment. This was one of many places that lost many visitors due to Covid.</p>\n\n<p>It got dark quickly, we had our dinner and went to see a ceremony.

				"content_text": "**Day 77**\n\nIn the morning we got on the plane to fly to *Pucallpa* with the goals to get to know the daily life of local Peruvian jungle communities and participate in *ayahuasca* ceremonies.\n\nIn the airport, we were greeted by Alberto, an uncle of Peruvian friend Pio who we traveled with to Machu Picchu. We took a tuk-tuk to a river port and jumped in the boat. This was a boat that connects *Pucallpa* with the communities in the jungle. After a hot 2-hour boat ride which featured a blasting 2010s pop music playlist, we walked through a muddy road to take another tuk-tuk and after half an hour we reached our final destination, a village of *Ceilan*. \n\nOur tuk-tuk stopped next to uncle Alberto’s house and we immediately met a big part of their family: wife, kids, and grandmothers. A 2-minute walk from the house there was a huge area designed for accomodating guests and organizing ceremonies: barracks for sleeping, a kitchen/dining building, a shower, and 2 wooden temples. We met another friend from Machu Picchu Bogdan who was the only other guest/foreigner there at the moment. This was one of many places that lost many visitors due to Covid. \n\nIt got dark quickly, we had our dinner and went to see a ceremony. Today we were only spectators but it was an interesting spectacle, with many family members: grandmothers, cousins, brothers, and sisters joining to connect, drink *ayahuasca* and sing songs in *Shipibo*.

He was very close to nature during all the hike, stopping and examining the plants and doing little rituals along the way to express his gratitude to <em>Pachamama</em> (mother earth). We were woken up a couple of hours later by a rumble of thunder and strong rain. The lighting was constant and extremely bright. We had never experienced such a strong storm while being in our tents. One thing we hoped is that it ends before we need to start hiking.</p>\n\n<p>At 3:45 AM our guide shouted that it’s time to get moving. While we were dressing we could still some rain dropping on the top of the tent, however, by the time we were putting on the shoes the rain was over.</p>\n\n<p>After 5 minutes hike, we approached the entrance of the last section of <em>Inca Trail</em>. There we had to wait for rangers to come, check our documents and open the trail. We also saw all the people who hiked the trail at the same time as us. There was our group of 4 and three groups of 2 people, that’s it. Pre-covid we would have had a line of couple hundred people waiting.</p>\n\n<p>When we passed the checkpoint it was all about being fast. The goal was to arrive at Machu Picchu before people who come by trains and buses. We were absolutely flying throughout the trail for more than an hour, it felt as if the last three days were just a preparation for the last day’s sprint. We reached a midway point <em>Sun Gate</em>. There all the hikers were congratulating each other as we saw Machu Picchu for the first time from far away. This point can only be reached by people going Inca Trail. Our guide was amazed, he told that we are the first group since the beginning of September who didn’t have any clouds and fog and could see Machu Picchu from the <em>Sun Gate</em>.</p>\n\n<p>We started our last section of the hike towards Machu Picchu. Our Canadian friend who was the fastest hiker by far doing the whole trail managed to injure himself while posing for a picture. So he took a hiking pole and limped through the last part of the hike.</p>\n\n<p>The entrance of Machu Picchu for Inca Trail hikers is quite interesting. We just entered straight into it from the side, making other travelers wonder where we came from. Then we had to walk through Machu Picchu against the flow and exit through the actual entrance so our tickets could be checked and we could officially come back.</p>\n\n<p>The sun was shining and there were just a few clouds. We took pictures and had a guided tour through Machu Picchu. It was more beautiful and interesting than we expected. As such a touristic and well-advertised place sometimes it can be disappointing but it wasn’t the case for us. We learned how people were building it, how it was probably used, and how it was abandoned by <em>Quechua</em> people the moment they heard the Spanish were coming. The locals destroyed parts of the Inca Trail so it couldn’t be easily reached and after a while, Machu Picchu was covered by grass, trees and rediscovered only centuries later.</p>\n\n<p>After the tour, we said our goodbyes to fellow travelers and the guide. They were taking a train back home but we had another 3 hours of hiking as we chose a cheaper option of coming back by bus from the town nearby.</p>\n\n<p>For the first half-hour, we had a steep descent from Machu Picchu to the village of Machu Picchu. Our knees again reminded us of how they were treated the last couple of days. After we passed the village, we just had to follow the train track. The hike was more interesting than we expected. Next to Machu Picchu, it is the beginning of Amazon Jungle. So while on one side we saw mountains on the other we saw deep and dark forests. Our bodies felt that this is the last hike so the tiredness reached the peak point just before we reached the town of <em>Hidroelectica</em> and our van.</p>\n\n<p>We sat in our van and started the ride back to Cusco. It was anything but easy. It was hot, not air-conditioned and we never witnessed 6 hours of nonstop zig-zags through the mountains. We reached 4000m+ elevations and went down a couple of thousand meters before going up again. When we reached <em>Cusco</em> it was already late evening and we truly felt that the ride has demanded more than the hiking itself.</p>\n\n<p>Overall we are extremely happy with the experience we had. The trail itself, the weather, the fellow hikers, guide, chef, and porters made everything truly memorable.

And now, it was time for us to finally get a good night's sleep in a bed. \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/36f522f5b9.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/e4e82da2c6.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/757e490d87.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/9ea40c693d.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/5f55e73463.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/6d7f727c61.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/542c8fd582.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/3d69e4267d.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/9585d26a6d.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/4ec61eebbf.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/ffc303a374.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/e8b04baa56.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/03e124833c.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/7f753a6d69.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/53028315f6.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" />\n",

This is a famous trail that before Covid would require a reservation before a couple of months but now we arranged it before 4 days. Nevertheless, it’s a popular trail done almost all year round, and little did we know that the day is going to be a surprise even for the experienced guides.</p>\n\n<p>6 in the morning our guide knocked on the hotel door and picked us up. We sat in the van and met other travelers we are going with. Again, before covid cheaper tours would have 10-14 people, now it was just 4 of us, so we got a semi-private tour. We were lucky to meet two interesting guys. One of them was a 30-year-old Canadian who was already retired as he invested in crypto currencies <em>early enough</em>. Another guy was a Peruvian he met in the Amazonian jungle whose family is organizing shamanic ayahuasca rituals and he has a baby alligator as a pet. So we immediately understood that the hike is not going to be dull.</p>\n\n<p>The plan was to take 2.5h van ride to the entrance of the trail. We approached a small town 15km from the trail to pick up our porters, 6 guys who would carry all the food, tents, and kitchen equipment throughout the trail. We were told that some of them are late because of some strikes that are going on. We waited for 1 hour before all the porters arrived. We started moving again and headed towards the exit of the town. The first unusual thing we saw was a granny putting wood on the road and setting it to flames. As we couldn’t pass it our porters jumped from the van, moved the wood and we continued going. After 2 minutes we approached the bridge to exit the town but it was barricaded by local people. They were striking and even being asked nicely didn’t let us pass, even town mayor was there. We were told that all town is barricaded and all trains and buses are not running. The locals were protesting high gasoline prices but to get the attention of the government they chose their target - tourists going to Machu Picchu.</p>\n\n<p>We got the only reasonable choice to leave the van and walk an additional 15km on the Machu Picchu train track to the entrance of the trail, hoping that it won’t be barricaded in any way. In 20 years of going on this trail, our guide has never experienced such a thing. Our van driver told us that he won’t be able to come back to Cusco until it gets dark, as locals told him that they will throw stones if he tries to drive. It was a strange but overall nice walk. Despite the other problems, the weather was unusually good. Every 50m or so we would see entire trees, tires, stones put onto the train track, and roads to block it. It was a bit surreal. After around 3 hours we reached the entrance of the trail. There we met other groups of hikers who told us that the entrance is blocked as well and they cannot enter for a couple of hours already. It looked like we would need to camp there and wait for protests to end. However, in the end, they agreed to let us go which was a big relief.</p>\n\n<p>We started Inca Trail with a lunch.

				"content_html": "<p><strong>Day 52</strong></p>\n\n<p>Our plan in the morning was to rent a car and go around Sacred Valley close to Cusco. Unfortunately, we didn’t succeed in rental but instead, we asked and were driven to a place where “colectivos” (van buses) go to the small town that we wanted.</p>\n\n<p>We arrived in <em>Chincheros</em> - the city that is famous for its handicrafts, especially weaving. The streets were full of sellers offering their handmade things mostly textile.</p>\n\n<p>As we got into a random shop, one crafter started showing us how they dye their wool, where they get those natural colors from, etc. Then followed the demonstration of their method of weaving and thread-making which I also got to try.

The streets were full of sellers offering their handmade things mostly textile.\n\nAs we got into a random shop, one crafter started showing us how they dye their wool, where they get those natural colors from, etc. Then followed the demonstration of their method of weaving and thread-making which I also got to try.

We waved each other goodbye until the afternoon and all started hiking at our own pace.</p>\n\n<p>The hike was a true test to ankles and shins as we descended 1.2km down. The heat also increased substantially during the day, even with some fires and smokes going around.</p>\n\n<p>When we arrived at our accommodation we were eager to jump into the hot spring water pools that the place was known for. We were surprised to find not 4 but 8 French people already in there.

We had our breakfast with 2 French couples who turned out to have chosen the same final destination as we did. We waved each other goodbye until the afternoon and all started hiking at our own pace.\n\nThe hike was a true test to ankles and shins as we descended 1.2km down. The heat also increased substantially during the day, even with some fires and smokes going around.\n\nWhen we arrived at our accommodation we were eager to jump into the hot spring water pools that the place was known for. We were surprised to find not 4 but 8 French people already in there.

As the second deepest canyon in the world, it promised a lot of views, hikes, and interesting accommodations to us. However, the day didn’t quite start as planned.</p>\n\n<p>The van ride was hard to take. Constant turns and quick stops not only didn’t allow us to sleep but also made us pray for the ride to end as soon as possible. I and Gabriele both felt dizzy, but for me especially, even anti-motion sickness medicine has proven to be useless. 4 hours into the trip, with less than an hour remaining I couldn’t take it anymore and started puking from motion-sickness 🤢, the first time since childhood. Someone opened the door and I jumped from the van telling Gabriele that I’m not coming back to it. The guide in the van wasn’t too surprised, Gabriele took out the bags, he wished her good luck and the van left.</p>\n\n<p>We didn’t have any reception in the area, but the workers around had shown us which direction to walk to reach the town. We were already at an altitude that is not familiar to us and also the first hour we continued walking uphill. Although we were catching our breath, I was just extremely happy not to be in that damned van.</p>\n\n<p>The hike was unexpected, pretty tough but we didn’t lose our spirit. The views were incredible which we wouldn’t have been able to see and appreciate otherwise. The cars and vans passing by were beeping and offering a ride but taking it was out of the question. When we reached the highest part of the road, Gabriele bought a colorful hat from a local Peruvian woman 👒.</p>\n\n<p>We finally arrived at the <em>Cabanaconde</em> town in the afternoon with the burning legs. Although the town is in the canyon it wasn’t touristy at all. Everywhere around in the canyon agriculture and farming is far more important and we witnessed workers finishing their day. We had our dinner and coca tea served by a local granny which was a perfect ending to a <em>rollercoaster</em> day.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/9f8395af7b.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/bd75be80c0.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/00fca4cc04.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/9fa4431431.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/4657ebaa72.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/17682d024c.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/1a83908341.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/f30b44c111.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n",

It welcomed us with the epic evening views and total freedom to explore the surroundings 🧭.  \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/7ea1b16bef.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/b1a6a7daf3.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/429a5d1b9b.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/134d29f730.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/2986b3edda.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/3a35cb2cd6.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" />\n",

Brazilians loved it cheering every single move and roaring when he moved into the first place.\n\nSeconds after the finish flag was waved, the local crowd simply cut holes in the fences, jumped over the barriers, and ran into the track. We happily joined the party and started running to the opposite side of the track to witness the ceremony. We felt the length and incline of the track ourselves as we only reached the main straight the moment the ceremony ended. \n\nThe mood on the track was cheerful and peaceful, as people were chanting, taking pictures, and hoping to see any of the drivers. \n\nWhat a weekend!\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/09a97bf9e6.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/4b7755c076.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/49087ad8f0.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/8ae47743fb.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/aee44bb187.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/3321a1ad24.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/1ffabad26c.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"uploads/2021/824285e5fa.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" />\n",
